## 🎨 Key Features Explained

### Smart Assignment Algorithm
The smart assign feature automatically assigns tasks to the team member with the fewest active (Todo/In Progress) tasks, ensuring balanced workload distribution.

### Conflict Resolution
When two users edit the same task simultaneously, the system detects conflicts and provides three resolution options:
- **Keep Current**: Use the server version
- **Use My Version**: Overwrite with your changes  
- **Merge Changes**: Combine both versions (recommended)

### Real-time Updates
All changes are instantly synchronized across all connected clients using Socket.IO, providing a truly collaborative experience.

### Activity Logging
Every action (create, update, delete, assign) is logged and displayed in the live activity feed with timestamps and user information.
